# INFO101-Python-Project

This project uses a report in csv format downloaded from Amazon at this link https://www.amazon.com/gp/b2b/reports
Anyone with an Amazon account can download a report like this, including businesses that use the service.

My data ranges from 04/12/20 - 04/16/22, over two years worth of transactions.

If using a windows machine you will have to change the file path. There is probably an elegant solution to handling this discrepancy, but I have not provided such a solution.
